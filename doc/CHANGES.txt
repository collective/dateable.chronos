dateable.chronos Changes
=========================

dateable.chronos 0.7.0 (2009-11-27)
===================================

* Added Month/Week/Day view attributes on the event list. Also added
  IListCalendarEnhanced interface. If you mark a calendar with 
  IListCalendarEnhanced instead of ICalendarEnhanced, then these new list
  views will be used for Month/Week/Day views instead of the grid ones.
  [regebro]
  
* Got rid of that annoying '-C' that pops up in some URLs when you navigates.
  [regebro]
  
* Dropped official Plone 3.0 and 3.1 support. It probably still works, but
  the buildouts have for some reason stopped working.
  [regebro]

dateable.chronos 0.6.2 (2009-09-22)
===================================

* Added Czech translation.
  [naro]

* Added Japanese translation.
  [tyam]

* Added Turkish translation (in fact this was added to 0.6.1, but not noted
  in the changes.)
  [tyam]

* Corrections to the italian translation.
  [massimo]
  
* The KSS JS is now enable also for anonymous users.
  [regebro]

dateable.chronos 0.6.1 (2009-06-30)
===================================

* Added Italian translation.
  [massimo]
  
* Added Polish Translation by Magdalena Regebro and Danish translation by
  Alexander Pilz.
  [regebro]
  
* Updated translations as best I could. 
  [regebro]
  
* The localization of the time format now uses the localization support for
  date and time formats in zope.i18n.
  [regebro]

dateable.chronos 0.6 (2009-06-25)
=================================
* Added norwegian translation by Mats Tande <mats@tande.net>. 
  [regebro]
  
* Put in a larger space between the List-tabs and the other tabs as a
  distinguishing marker. This is in CSS so it can be easily overridden.
  [regebro]

* Added a class onto a day of the month view if that day has events
  [cwainwright]

* Properly localized the format of hours shown on the Day and Week views.
  [erikrose,catherine-w]
  
* Testing improvements.
  [erikrose]

dateable.chronos 0.5 (2009-05-03)
=================================

* Fixed an issue where utils.get_view_day would choke on a day that
  didn't exist in the month.
  [claytron]
  
* Several improvements of i18n including German translation.
  [xo7,paulox]  

dateable.chronos 0.4 (2008-10-04)
=================================

* fixed the getEventDisplays method for day.py to use the 
  getOccurrencesInDay method since it already does the work for us
  and it passes in the request.form so we can modify the search.
  [claytron]

* fixed the calendar_view_tabs macro so that the id gets the proper
  title from the action, thus validating the page.
  [claytron]

* made the menu items actions (day, month, week, list, past) keep
  what we had in the request
  [lucielejard]

* when we get the occurrences in a day, made the day end at 11:59pm
  instead of 12am the next day. This was causing events starting at
  12am to start displaying the day before.
  [lucielejard]

* hooked up the selection of the hour height for the day view
  [lucielejard]

* hooked up the selection of how many events we want to display
  on the month view and if we even want to have a limit
  [lucielejard]

* hooked up the selection of "start hour" and "end hour" 
  (site setup -> chronos configuration) with the day and week views. 
  [lucielejard]
 
* updated the display of events that last more than one day (on day and 
  week views). This is possible thanks to the variable column_day that
  allows you to know on which day you are displaying the event, and then
  to know where to start/stop displaying the event on this day.
  [lucielejard]
 
* introduced two variables, before_line and after_line, to know
  if we have to display the gray lines at the top and bottom of the
  day and month views. For example, if your day starts at 12am, you 
  don't need the grey line at the top, since there won't be any event
  before 12am on this day.
  [lucielejard]
 
* allowed to select "24" as the end time on the manage calendar
  form, to be able to display hours until midnight on day and
  month views.
  [lucielejard]

* Fixed the _get_view_url_for_date so that it properly checks the days in the
  month.  http://plone.org/products/dateable/issues/7

dateable.chronos 0.3 (2008-07-09)
=================================

* Recurring event support

* Nicer stylings

* Add event feature improvements

* And much, much more.
